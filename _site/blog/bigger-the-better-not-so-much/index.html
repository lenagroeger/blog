Not just about the content of the reports (although there is plenty to be concerned with on that front), but about what <i>the reaction</i> to the leak means for the media and the public. Specifically, the lack of much reaction at all. NYU journalism professor Jay Rosen points out that often huge revelations produce the smallest consequences (how </span><span style="font-size: small;">sadly ironic)</span><span style="font-size: small;">. At some level, the information overload is so great that people just ignore it and move on to something more bite-sized.</span></div><div style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Some quotes: </span></div><blockquote style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><div><span style="font-size: 90%;">'We tend to think: big revelations mean big reactions. But if the  story is too big and crashes too many illusions, the exact opposite  occurs.'  My fear is that this will happen with the Afghanistan logs.  Reaction will be unbearably lighter than we have a right to expect&#8211; not  because the story isn't sensational or troubling enough, but because  it's too troubling, a mess we cannot fix and therefore prefer to forget.</span> </div></blockquote><blockquote style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><div><span style="font-size: 90%;">Last week, it was the Washington Post's big series, <a href="http://projects.washingtonpost.com/top-secret-america/">Top Secret America</a>,  two years in the making. It reported on the massive security shadowland  that has arisen since 09/11. The Post basically showed that there is no  accountability, no knowledge at the center of what the system as a  whole is doing, and too much "product" to make intelligent use of.   We're wasting billions upon billions of dollars on an intelligence  system that does not work. It's an explosive finding but the explosive  reactions <a href="http://www.salon.com/news/opinion/glenn_greenwald/2010/07/23/intelligence/index.html">haven't followed</a>,  not because the series didn't do its job, but rather: the job of fixing  what is broken would break the system responsible for such fixes.</span> </div></blockquote><blockquote style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><div><span style="font-size: 90%;">The mental model on which most investigative journalism is based  states that explosive revelations lead to public outcry; elites get the  message and reform the system.  But what if elites believe that reform  is impossible because the problems are too big, the sacrifices too  great, the public too distractible?  What if cognitive dissonance has  been insufficiently accounted for in our theories of how great  journalism worksâ€¦ and often fails to work?</span> </div><span style="font-size: 90%;"></span></blockquote><blockquote style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><span style="font-size: 90%;">I don't have the answer; I don't even know if I have framed the right problem.</span></blockquote><div style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Regardless of how it is framed, I think Rosen has identified a troubling problem.</span> How does one communicate truly consequential ideas or findings in a way that has real consequence? How do you get someone out from under a pile of information to go act (and react) in the world? Is it a matter of being overwhelmed into paralysis or not really caring to begin with? <span style="font-size: small;">Some questions worth considering.</span><br /><span style="font-size: small;"> </span><br /><span style="font-size: small;">The rest of Rosen's post also brings up a number of points about the nature of WikiLeaks (the "world's first stateless news organization") and the rise of the political press.
