Snow's "The Two Cultures." I've come across this essay &#8212; originally a lecture in 1959 &#8212; several times over the past year, mostly in the context of "look what a knowledge gap there is between scientists and the public" or "scientists are just fundamentally different people from the rest." Snow articulates a serious problem he notices in Western society: the splitting of intellectual life (and in turn, practical life) into two polar groups that do not communicate and do not understand one another. These two groups, literary intellectuals and scientists, have become increasingly isolated by a "gulf of mutual incomprehension." The gulf is widened by hostility, distortion, and most of all just a lack of understanding. In later writings, Snow called for a "third culture" to bridge this gap.<br /><br />Even though Snow was writing 50 years ago, his observations are still relevant today. Many recent articles and books reference the "two cultures" theme, although it seems the modern flavor of this dichotomy has shifted &#8212; less "science &amp; humanities" and more "science &amp; everyone else". Those who can speak science to the masses &#8212; bypassing the literary intellectuals &#8212; are what John Brockman, editor of the Edge magazine, calls "<a href="http://www.edge.org/3rd_culture/">third-culture thinkers.</a>" This brand of intellectuals include people like E.O. Wilson, Stephen Jay Gould, Steven Pinker, Richard Dawkins, and Daniel Dennett. The success of popular science books may surprise the "old-style intellectuals," (Brockman's phrase) but he thinks this is just a sign that science is becoming the new popular culture. </div><div style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br /></div><blockquote style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><i>"The third culture consists of those scientists and other thinkers in the empirical world who, through their work and expository writing, are taking the place of the traditional intellectual in rendering visible the deeper meanings of our lives, redefining who and what we are...</i> </blockquote><blockquote style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><i><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif; font-size: small;">Today, third-culture thinkers tend to avoid the middleman              and endeavor to express their deepest thoughts in a manner accessible              to the intelligent reading public.</span><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif; font-size: small;"> The recent publishing successes of serious science books have surprised              only the old-style intellectuals. Their view is that these books are              anomalies--that they are bought but not read. I disagree. The emergence              of this third-culture activity is evidence that many people have a              great intellectual hunger for new and important ideas and are willing              to make the effort to educate themselves." </span></i><br /><div align="left"></div></blockquote><div style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />While I do agree with much of Brockman's characterization, I have some concerns about these "third culture" scientists. Thinking it sufficient to communicate directly to the public, they sometimes ignore the arts and humanities altogether, or act as if science has taken its "rightful" place at the top of the intellectual kingdom. To build a bridge across the gulf, there must be collaboration and openness between the disciplines &#8212; what Jonah Lehrer's calls a "<a href="http://seedmagazine.com/content/article/the_future_of_science_is_art/">fourth culture.</a>" </div><div style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br /></div><blockquote style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><i>"This fourth culture, much closer in concept to Snow's original definition… will ignore arbitrary intellectual boundaries, seeking instead to blur the lines that separate. It will freely transplant knowledge between the sciences and humanities, and will focus on connecting the reductionist fact to our actual experience. It will take a pragmatic view of truth, and it will judge truth not by its origins but by its usefulness."</i> (from <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Proust-Was-Neuroscientist-Jonah-Lehrer/dp/0618620109"><i>Proust Was a Neuroscientist</i></a>)</blockquote><div style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />Chris Mooney, author of Unscientific America, <a href="http://www.scienceprogress.org/2008/01/one-culture-two-culture-three-culture-four/">agrees</a> with Lehrer. But he takes the argument one step further, urging science to interact and learn from all parts of society. </div><div style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br /></div><blockquote style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><i>"It's not just that we need people transplanting knowledge between science and humanities&#8211;it's that we need people who can transplant between science, the humanities, politics, communication, law, business&#8211;and everything else. All other walks of life, types of talent, kinds of expertise…the more science draws upon these and the more these intersect with science, the closer science will move back into relationship with the society that fosters it." </i></blockquote><div style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br /></div><div style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">For Mooney, science should not attempt to take the place of other intellectual traditions, but rather it should mesh and share ideas freely with all of them. </div><div style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br /></div><div style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">And at this rate (with enough communication, interaction, and Snow's 1959 lecture firmly in mind) we may end up with a fourth, fifth, or sixth culture sooner than we expect.</div><div style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br /></div><div style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br /></div><div style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">Related link: <a href="http://seedmagazine.com/twocultures/">Are We Beyond the Two Cultures?</a> Video series from seedmagazine.com</div>
