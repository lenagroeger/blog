After hopping and squealing around my room in excitement, I sat down and read the <a href="http://journals.lww.com/acsm-healthfitness/pages/default.aspx">From the Editor</a> at the beginning of the journal:</span><br /><blockquote><span style="font-size: 90%;">The risk of injury is low when doing moderate-intensity physical activity, but increases with exercise intensity, especially in a competitive environment. And in this regard, female athletes are at a higher risk than male athletes. In her feature, Injury Risks for the Female Athlete, Marielena Groeger, B.A., provides a concise review of women's unique physiological and biomechanical responses to exercise that influences risk, and outlines measures that can be taken to prevent injury. Given the large number of girls and women involved in fitness programs and competitive sports, this article is an important read for all of us.</span></blockquote><br /><span style="font-size: small;">Yeah! So super happy about this.<br /><br />(If you wanna read it, email me and I'll send you the final PDF)<br /><br />And thanks to Hannah for this very <a href="http://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/06/30/phys-ed-what-exercise-science-doesnt-know-about-women/">relevant article</a> in the NY Times about exercise science and women.</span>        </div>
