<p>What started as a folder called "Wee Things" on my desktop became something of an obsession over the past year. Here's my most comprehensive take of all the ways small visual forms and tiny details can make a huge difference to the design of everything from  graphics to usability: <a href="http://www.propublica.org/nerds/item/a-big-article-about-wee-things">A Big Article About Wee Things: A guide to using little things to make better graphics and interactives.</a>, ProPublica</p>
