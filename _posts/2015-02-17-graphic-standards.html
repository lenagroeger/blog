<p>It was 1915 and the American Statistical Association wanted some STANDARDS. So they put out <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/pdf/2965153.pdf">a paper about it</a>. Funny to think that notions like charts going from left to right and including a zero-based vertical scale were novel ideas that needed articulating. But when the stakes are a potential "gain to mankind," then I suppose it's worth getting serious about. Also, nice use of adorable little arrows. </p>

<blockquote>If simple and convenient standards can be found and made generally known, there will be possible a more universal use of graphic methods with a consequent gain to mankind because of the greater speed and accuracy with which complex information may be imparted and interpreted. </em>
