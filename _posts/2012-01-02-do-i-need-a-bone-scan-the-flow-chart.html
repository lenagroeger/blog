<p>I don't love flowcharts. Most of the ones I've seen are totally useless or <a href="http://www.good.is/tag/flowchart" target="_blank">just silly</a>. But I think the <a href="http://xkcd.com/518/" target="_blank">simple form</a> of a flowchart can actually be pretty useful for explaining a complicated subject (that is, when that subject isn't<a href="http://thatdowdygirl.files.wordpress.com/2009/07/o_gov-run_healthcare_flowchart1.jpg" target="_blank"> beyond all hope</a>). <a href="http://motherjones.com/politics/2011/12/campaign-finance-flow-chart" target="_blank">This one on campaign finance</a>, for example, is easy to follow and packs in a decent amount of info into a relatively small space.</p>

<p>Here's one I did for a health reporting class on bone scans (and whether or not you need one). The current recommendations are tucked away in <a href="http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf/uspsoste.htm" target="_blank">obscure reports</a>, and according to the doctors I talked to, many people who should be getting bone scans aren't. The chart's not great, but it's one attempt to lay out the information. Just for fun, I made it in the style of a typical <a href="http://www.wired.com/magazine/2010/11/st_flowchart_social/" target="_blank">Wired flowchart</a>.</p>

<p>Here's the <a href="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/7945837/bonescan.html" target="_blank">bigger version</a>.</p>
