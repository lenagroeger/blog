Don't say it; draw it! Tim Jones, a science communicator in London, has initiated a <a href="http://seedmagazine.com/slideshow/exquisite_corpse/">worldwide science art project</a> collecting drawings from scientists, students, journalists, artists &#8212; in short, just about everyone. In an attempt to find out the true narratives behind people's view of science, he "<i>persuaded friends and even complete strangers&#8211;all of whom belonged to one of three categories: scientists, professional communicators, and the general public&#8211;to sit down with a pen and paper and draw what they think is important in science.</i>" I think this is a pretty cool idea, and will be checking to see how the project develops. Add your own drawing to the mosaic <a href="http://communicatescience.com/corpse/exquisite_corpse_of_science.html">here</a>. <br /></div>
