So last week at <a href="http://scienceonline2012.com/" target="_blank">Science Online 2012</a>, the amazing <a href="http://twitter.com/onthewag" target="_blank">Ruth Spencer</a> and I rambled a bit about data journalism. The main product &#8212; still evolving &#8212; is <a href="http://speeddataing.tumblr.com/" target="_blank">this tumblr blog</a>, which is our attempt to gather our thoughts and lots of resources for people interested in getting started in collecting, interrogating and visualizing data. It could have been called "Everything I know about data journalism I learned from ProPublica and the NY Times." But we decided to call it <a href="http://speeddataing.tumblr.com/" target="_blank">Speed Data-ing</a>. Yes, it took us many iterations to come up with that one.

This was one alternate title:

We are assured that's it's gonna be an option for #scio13.
