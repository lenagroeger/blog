It'd be fair to say it was one of the first pieces of writing to get me interested in the whole mind/body problem and philosophy in general. I had completely forgotten about it. It's pretty amazing (in a gross but awesome sci-fi way).</div><div style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br /></div><div style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><i>They're Made out of Meat</i>, by Terry Bisson<br /><br /><span style="font-size: 85%;">"They're made out of meat."<br />"Meat?"<br />"Meat. They're made out of meat."<br />"Meat?"<br />"There's no doubt about it. We picked up several from different parts of the planet, took them aboard our recon vessels, and probed them all the way through. They're completely meat."<br />"That's impossible. What about the radio signals? The messages to the stars?"<br />"They use the radio waves to talk, but the signals don't come from them. The signals come from machines."<br />"So who made the machines? That's who we want to contact."<br />"They made the machines. That's what I'm trying to tell you. Meat made the machines."<br />"That's ridiculous. How can meat make a machine? You're asking me to believe in sentient meat."<br />"I'm not asking you, I'm telling you. These creatures are the only sentient race in that sector and they're made out of meat."<br />"Maybe they're like the orfolei. You know, a carbon-based intelligence that goes through a meat stage."<br />"Nope. They're born meat and they die meat. We studied them for several of their life spans, which didn't take long. Do you have any idea what's the life span of meat?"<br />"Spare me. Okay, maybe they're only part meat. You know, like the weddilei. A meat head with an electron plasma brain inside."<br />"Nope. We thought of that, since they do have meat heads, like the weddilei. But I told you, we probed them. They're meat all the way through."<br />"No brain?"<br />"Oh, there's a brain all right. It's just that the brain is made out of meat! That's what I've been trying to tell you."<br />"So ... what does the thinking?"<br />"You're not understanding, are you? You're refusing to deal with what I'm telling you. The brain does the thinking. The meat."<br />"Thinking meat! You're asking me to believe in thinking meat!"<br />"Yes, thinking meat! Conscious meat! Loving meat. Dreaming meat. The meat is the whole deal!  Are you beginning to get the picture or do I have to start all over?"<br />"Omigod. You're serious then. They're made out of meat."<br />"Thank you. Finally. Yes. They are indeed made out of meat. And they've been trying to get in touch with us for almost a hundred of their years."<br />"Omigod. So what does this meat have in mind?"<br />"First it wants to talk to us. Then I imagine it wants to explore the Universe, contact other sentiences, swap ideas and information. The usual."<br />"We're supposed to talk to meat."<br />"That's the idea. That's the message they're sending out by radio. 'Hello. Anyone out there. Anybody home.' That sort of thing."<br />"They actually do talk, then. They use words, ideas, concepts?"<br />"Oh, yes. Except they do it with meat."<br />"I thought you just told me they used radio."<br />"They do, but what do you think is on the radio? Meat sounds. You know how when you slap or flap meat, it makes a noise? They talk by flapping their meat at each other. They can even sing by squirting air through their meat." <br />"Omigod. Singing meat. This is altogether too much. So what do you advise?"<br />"Officially or unofficially?"<br />"Both."<br />"Officially, we are required to contact, welcome and log in any and all sentient races or multibeings in this quadrant of the Universe, without prejudice, fear or favor. Unofficially, I advise that we erase the records and forget the whole thing."<br />"I was hoping you would say that."<br />"It seems harsh, but there is a limit. Do we really want to make contact with meat?"<br />"I agree one hundred percent. What's there to say? 'Hello, meat. How's it going?' But will this work? How many planets are we dealing with here?"<br />"Just one. They can travel to other planets in special meat containers, but they can't live on them. And being meat, they can only travel through C space. Which limits them to the speed of light and makes the possibility of their ever making contact pretty slim. Infinitesimal, in fact."<br />"So we just pretend there's no one home in the Universe."<br />"That's it."<br />"Cruel. But you said it yourself, who wants to meet meat? And the ones who have been aboard our vessels, the ones you probed? You're sure they won't remember?"<br />"They'll be considered crackpots if they do. We went into their heads and smoothed out their meat so that we're just a dream to them."<br />"A dream to meat! How strangely appropriate, that we should be meat's dream."<br />"And we marked the entire sector unoccupied."<br />"Good. Agreed, officially and unofficially. Case closed. Any others? Anyone interesting on that side of the galaxy?"<br />"Yes, a rather shy but sweet hydrogen core cluster intelligence in a class nine star in G445 zone. Was in contact two galactic rotations ago, wants to be friendly again." <br />"They always come around."<br />"And why not? Imagine how unbearably, how unutterably cold the Universe would be if one were all alone ..."</span></div><div style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br /></div><div style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br /></div><div style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">Apparently, some fans also made a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gaFZTAOb7IE">short video</a> version of the story. </div><div style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br /></div>
