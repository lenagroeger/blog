<div style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">Somehow <a href="http://seedmagazine.com/content/article/of_design_and_being_just/">this article</a> in Seed Magazine manages to combine almost every single one of my interests &#8212; remarkable. I can't wait for more from Seed's design column.  As I try to write my personal statement for grad school and form a coherent narrative about my interests and my life, it's a nice reminder that philosophy, science and design <i>can</i> all be connected!<br /><br />More links: <br /><a href="http://www.moma.org/interactives/exhibitions/2008/elasticmind/">Design and the Elastic Mind</a>, 2008 MoMA exhibit<br /><a href="http://seedmagazine.com/content/article/core_principles/">Core Principles</a>, an earlier Seed article about the interface of science and design <br /></div>
