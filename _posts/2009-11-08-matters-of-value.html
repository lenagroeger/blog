<div style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"> The House passage of a health care bill means we're a little bit closer to getting some real health care reform in the United States. But the health care debate will undoubtedly continue even after a final vote on the matter (whenever that happens... fingers crossed for this year!) Health encompasses so much more than insurance and medical care &#8212; income, education, and other background social conditions all play a crucial role in improving health. And all of these conditions, which provide the structure and support for a healthy society, are informed by our deeper values: liberty, efficiency, responsibility, and fairness, to name a few. Exploring these values in more detail is a collection of essays by the Hastings Center, <a href="http://valuesconnection.thehastingscenter.org/connecting-values-with-health-reform/">Connecting American Values with Health Reform</a>. It's worth a read, as it both grounds the current discussion about reform to greater ideals, and also points to constructive ways to continue the conversation, regardless of the final legislation. <br /></div><div style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br /></div>
