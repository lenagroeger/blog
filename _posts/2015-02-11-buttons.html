<p>A very, extremely detailed look at the history of buttons and our often frustrating experiences pushing them.</p>

<blockquote>This adds to the uncertainties of the modern button pusher: Am I actually doing this now and have full responsibility, or am I just making a humble request, and the machine can be counted on to save me from any serious blunders and hazards? Or is it something in between? In clicking the “Coffee” button, do you feel confident that the machine will stop pouring in time? Does it assume a certain cup size (and is this cup size the correct one?) or does it sense the level inside the cup? Might it pour coffee even if you fail to set down a cup? <em><br></br>Such everyday button anxieties may appear petty and inconsequential, but certainly not all of our modern artifacts are as harmless as coffee machines.</em>
