<p>The two-week countdown to graduation has begun (wha?!?) which means equal parts celebration and hyperventilation. Next up, I'm super excited to be starting an internship at <a href="http://www.propublica.org/" target="_blank">ProPublica</a> &#8212; a total shift from the psychology/neuroscience news realm I've been operating in the past few months. In particular, I'll be writing more explanatory type pieces, <a href="http://scienceline.org/2011/12/the-trouble-with-eyewitness-identification-explained/" target="_blank">like this one</a> on the failures of eyewitness identification (I originally sent this piece in as a "sample" explainer; it's now been updated slightly since October.)</p>

<p>And yes, OK, I clearly failed to pull myself entirely away from psychology (workin' on it!) But the uncertainty of memory is so fascinating &#8212; and has so many legal and political consequences &#8212; that I couldn't resist. The issue won't be going away any time soon.</p>
