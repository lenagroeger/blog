Apparently, Christmas displays reduce feelings of well-being and positive mood in people who don't celebrate the holiday. (I know, I know, if your first reaction is anything like mine, it's &#8212; they actually did a study on this?! Seriously?) But I kid you not, here's the abstract: </span><br /><blockquote><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 90%;">In two experiments we examined the differential psychological consequences of being in the presence of a Christmas display on participants who did or did not celebrate Christmas (Study 1), or who identified as Christian, Buddhist, or Sikh (Study 2). Participants completed measures of psychological well-being in a cubicle that either did or did not contain a small Christmas display. Across several indicators of well-being, the display harmed non-celebrators and non-Christians, but enhanced well-being for celebrators and Christians. In Study 2, we found that the negative effect of the display on non-Christians was mediated by reduced feelings of inclusion. The results raise concerns about the ubiquitous presence of dominant cultural symbols (such as Christmas displays) in culturally diverse societies. </span></blockquote><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;">No, I don't think we need to go out and immediately eradicate all Christmas displays. But the study does challenge a few assumptions about the harmlessness of certain symbols in public spaces.<br /><br />But, since </span><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;"><i>Happy Holidays</i></span><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;"> has a kind of empty ring to it, I'm still going to go ahead and say &#8212; all positive feelings and good cheer intended &#8212; </span><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;"><i>Merry Christmas! </i></span>
